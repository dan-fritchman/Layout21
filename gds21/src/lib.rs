//! # Gds21 Integrated Circuit Layout Parser & Writer
//!
//! GDSII is the IC industry's de facto standard for storing and sharing layout data.
//! Gds21 is a library for reading and creating GDSII data, similar to and largely inspired by libraries such as [gdstk](https://github.com/heitzmann/gdstk) and its predecessor [gdspy](https://github.com/heitzmann/gdspy).
//! Gds21 differs in being designed primarily as an interface layer to GDSII for the larger [Layout21](https://github.com/dan-fritchman/Layout21) library.
//! Reading and generating GDSII-format data are primary goals;
//! offering ease-of-use functionality for more elaborate manipulations of GDS data is not.
//! (Although these manipulations can be performed on Gds21's data structures).
//! Gds21 accordingly stores layout data on GDSII's terms, using GDSII's idioms, naming conventions, and datatypes.
//!
//! Layout data is represented in three primary forms:
//!
//! * A short tree with three layers:
//!   * The root is a [`GdsLibrary`], which primarily consists of a set of cells ([`GdsStruct`]s), and secondarily a set of metadata.
//!     Each [`GdsLibrary`] is a universe unto itself, in that it has no mechanisms for comprehending layout cells or data defined outside itself.
//!     On-disk each [`GdsLibrary`] is typically paired one-to-one with a `.gds` file.
//!   * Libraries consist of cell definitions AKA [`GdsStruct`]s, which define each layout cell (or module, or "struct" in GDSII terms).
//!   * Cells consist of [`GdsElement`]s, an enumeration which includes individual polygons ([`GdsBoundary`]),
//!     instances of other layout cells ([`GdsStructRef`]), text ([`GdsTextElem`]), and a few other geometric elements.
//! * For storage on disk, the [`GdsLibrary`] tree is flattened to a series of [`GdsRecord`]s.
//!   These records indicate the beginning, end, and content of each tree-node.
//!   Detailed descriptions of these records comprise the majority of the GDSII spec.
//! * Records are stored on-disk in binary form as detailed in the GDSII spec.
//!   Each includes a record-type header, datatype, length field, and optional additional content.
//!   These raw-bytes are never stored by Gds21, only generated and consumed on their way into and out of [`Read`] and [`Write`] objects (typically [`File`]s).
//!
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Loading a [`GdsLibrary`] from disk:
//!
//! ```skip
//! let lib = GdsLibrary::load("sample.gds")?;
//! ```
//!
//! Creating a new and empty [`GdsLibrary`], and adding a [`GdsStruct`] cell-definition:
//!
//! ```
//! use gds21::{GdsLibrary, GdsStruct};
//! let mut lib = GdsLibrary::new("mylib");
//! lib.structs.push(GdsStruct::new("mycell"));
//! ```
//!
//! Saving a [`GdsLibrary`] to disk:
//!
//! ```skip
//! lib.save("mylib.gds");
//! ```
//!
//! ## Serialization
//!
//! Each element in Gds21's [`GdsLibrary`] tree is [`serde`]-serializable.
//! GDSII data can be straightforwardly serialized in any serde-supported format.
//! Examples:
//!
//! ```text
//! let lib = gds21::GdsLibrary::new("mylib");
//! let json = serde_json::to_string(&lib);
//! let yaml = serde_yaml::to_string(&lib);
//! let toml = toml::to_string(&lib);
//! ```
//!
//! Gds21 includes built-in support for a subset of serde-formats via its [`SerializationFormat`] enumeration,
//! and support for directly reading and writing files in each format via its accompanying [`SerdeFile`] trait.
//! Example using [`SerializationFormat::Yaml`]:
//!
//! ```skip
//! use gds21::SerializationFormat::Yaml;
//! let lib = gds21::GdsLibrary::new("mylib");
//!
//! // Write to YAML-format file
//! Yaml.save(&lib, "mylib.gds.yaml")?;
//! // And read back from file
//! let lib2: gds21::GdsLibrary = Yaml.open("mylib.gds.yaml")?;  
//! ```
//!
//! Note these text-based representations will generally be substantially larger than binary GDSII data.
//!
